# Reproducing the results in JASA-TM-2024-0092

This document serves the Round 2 revision of this paper.


## Hardware requirement:  computing cluster, such as Unity
* Simulations in this code are likely infeasible to run on personal computers.  Therefore, all reproducibility details are written for running on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, such as Unity.  In this document, we will use Unity with Slurm queueing system.
* In this work, we use the word "Magpie" as the anonymized username.



## Steps to reproduce simulation results




## Steps to reproduce data example results

1. Example 1: Run 'data-examples/example1.m'</li>
2. Example 2: Run 'data/examples/example2.m'</li>
